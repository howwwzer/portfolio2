        <h3>Step 1: Identifying a Need</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <div>
                <p>
                    An academic advisor in the College of Arts and Letters reached out to request a redesign for the MSU Student Information System (SIS). The MSU SIS interface at the time of this project was implemented in 2021 when I first enrolled as a student. I had never used the previous interface, but through personal experience and hearing both staff and peer complaints, it was clear that the "update" was a source of frustration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine the focus of the project, we first conducted an in-depth client interview which revealed that the advising and enrollment sections were pain points worth investigating for research and the redesign. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Step 2: Research</h3>
            <p>
                Over a few weeks, our team investigated the pain points of the SIS interface through a series of surveys and guerilla interviews with undergraduate students at MSU. Below is a collection of survey results. 
            </p>
            <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">Overall SIS Rating</span></h4>
            <img src="/images/sis/studentsatisfaction.png" alt="survey results for student satisfation" style="max-width:100%;">
            <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">Adivsing Rating</span></h4>
            <img src="/images/sis/difficulty.png" alt="survey results for advising rating" style="max-width:100%;">
            <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">Student Perception</span></h4>
            <img src="/images/sis/piechart.png" alt="student perception pie chart" style="max-width:100%;">
            <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">Student Qualitative Responses</span></h4>
            <img src="/images/sis/qualitative.png" alt="qualitative survey responses for the advising system" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>
                The student survey found that no student had positive associations with the SIS and that they had plenty of ideas about ways to improve the advising process. The guerilla interview results presented similar results. The research conducted made it clear that students were not only confused by the student but also put off by it. Similar to our client's complaint about the “coldness” of the SIS, students felt that <span style="font-weight: 400;">the advising process was not only not human-centered but also impersonal. </span>
            </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Ideation &amp; Wireframing</h3>
            <p>
                As the main designer on this team, it was my job to manage the design-heavy parts of this project. To get started, I collected the information I needed from the various surveys and interviews conducted. I also took specific notes from the client's walkthrough video of her view of SIS, to see what specific design problems she encountered. I combined all of this information into a <span style="font-weight: 400;">design brief</span> that I shared with the rest of my team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used the design brief as a checklist of things to include in my early concept sketches, which can be seen below. I created <span style="font-weight: 400;">three potential task flows</span> in total: one for advisor scheduling from the perspective of the advisor, a student search process (for advisors), and finally an appointment scheduling process from the perspective of a student. 
            </p>
            <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">Advisor Screen Concepts</span></h4>
            <img src="/images/sis/advisorscreens.png" alt="pen-and-paper wireframes for the advisor task flow" style="max-width: 100%;">
            <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">Student Screen Concepts</span></h4>
            <img src="/images/sis/studentscreens.png" alt="pen-and-paper wireframes for the student task flow" style="max-width: 100%;">
            <p>
                From these sketches, I built a medium-fidelity task flow for the student screen concepts in Figma.
            </p>
            <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">Full Student Screen Task Flow</span></h4>
            <img src="/images/sis/mediumfidelitytaskflow.png" alt="medium fidelity wireframes for the student task flow" style="max-width: 100%;">
        <h3>Step 4: Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            To assess the new design that I created, my team and I asked fellow UX designers and SIS users to evaluate the design. One test involved putting all design ideas on display and letting users leave specific feedback on sticky notes next to the frame they had criticisms for. Feedback was also collected via a qualitative survey sent out to MSU students. This was a crucial step in determining what needed to be fixed within the wireframe.
        </p>
        <h4><span style="background-color: #b2cfff;">In-Person Feedback Session</span></h4>

        <h3 id="bottom">Final Deliverables</h3>
            <p>
                Due to the time constraints for this project, high-fidelity mockups were not requested. Instead, revised medium-fidelity wireframes were presented to the client, with proposed next steps to continue testing and development.

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
                In terms of technical skills, this project helped me practice techniques I hadn't had the opportunity to use before. Specifically, I got the chance to create and test wireframes on real users. Through this project, I was able to completely reimagine a process and see what users (who would genuinely be using this redesign) think of it. I was also able to test out new data collection techniques and apply the results to my designs. I will carry the skills I developed here to my career as a UX Designer.
